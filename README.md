this data comes from the 2023-2024 season for the Pomona-Pitzer Track and Field team (men and women). the data is made up of splits taken from an electronic timing system that the 400 group (which i am a part of) uses during our speed training. the goal of this endeavor is to see how speed training affects 400 performance. 

i want to note that this is mostly for the sake of practice in playing with data, and not in making hard conclusions. while i may be able to find some correlations, causation is not possible to conclude given the tiny size of the data set and countless confounding variables. it is hard to know whether a split or a race time is slow because an athlete is sick, injured, sleep-deprived, stressed, or if the training is not working. hopefully the effects of these confounding variables is minimized by me focusing on only our best performances, but I want to be sure to name them nonetheless.

also, a note about the data: a standing 30 meter time means that the athlete runs 30 meters from a standing start. it is a good measure of acceleration. a flying 30 meter time means that the athlete has some amount of distance to get up to speed, and then runs 30 meters, essentially measuring their max velocity.
